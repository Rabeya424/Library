The Great Hartland Community Library, run by a dedicated team of volunteers, serves a close-knit community by providing access to a diverse collection of books. However, the library currently relies on a manual system to manage its operations, which is both inefficient and prone to errors. This outdated system results in significant challenges, including difficulty in tracking book availability, time-consuming processes for checking books in and out, and a lack of accurate records, which hampers the overall service quality offered to patrons. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a digital solution that can streamline these operations and enhance the library's service efficiency. The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple, user-friendly prototype. of a computer-based system that can demonstrate how such a digital solution can work to improve the library's operations.
